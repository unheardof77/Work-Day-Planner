## Description

I built this project to help organize a busy life style.  This website can be used to anyone to save a daily schedule and modify it as well as see the times of there events.  I learned many things in this project like how to use Moment.  Moment is a JS extension that allows you to get accurate time and dates.  This was incredible helpful in the development of the time functions.
